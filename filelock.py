"""A very small subset of :mod:`filelock` used by the unit tests.

The real dependency provides a crossâ€‘platform file locking mechanism.  For the
purposes of the tests we only need the context manager interface to guarantee
that code paths expecting a lock object keep working.  This implementation
keeps a process wide map of locks keyed by the lock file path.  The behaviour is
good enough for single process tests and avoids pulling additional third party
dependencies into the execution environment.
